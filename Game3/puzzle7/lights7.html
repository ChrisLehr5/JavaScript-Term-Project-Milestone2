        <p>The history of lights out:</p>
        <p>This 5 x 5 grid game was created in 1995 on a handheld by Tiger electronics. A 3 x 3 grid was created in the 1970's - it relies on mathmatics to solve the light chasing method.</p>
        <p>If a light is on, it must be toggled an odd number of times to be turned off. If a light is off, it must be toggled an even number of times (including none at all) for it to remain off. Several conclusions are used for the game's strategy.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>How to play:</p>
        <p>Click on the light square to light the cube up, and click again to turn the cube off.</p>
        <p>When all the lights are in the "on" position - You've won! </p>
